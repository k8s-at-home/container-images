# Container Images

Kubernetes tailored container images for various applications. Hosted at https://hub.docker.com/r/k8sathome. 

Applications are checked every several hours for new releases.

## Purpose

_There's so many images out there, why do I want to use these?_

- Semantic versioning is awesome
- s6-overlay is not awesome
- ARM architectures are gaining popularity
- Multiple architecture support (amd64, arm64)
- Simplicity over complexity (e.g. only ubuntu:focal)

## Deployment Information

### Deployment on Kubernetes

Most of these containers can be used as drop-in-replacements for the images in our k8s-at-home [Helm charts](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/).
While we do not know if (or when) these containers will be the default for the Helm Charts, they work just fine!

Within docker-compose and other solutions, they should work just fine too but that isn't guaranteed. 
But please do report any bugs when you see them!

### Volumes
|   Path    | Description                         |
|:---------:|-------------------------------------|
|  `/app`   | Application install directory       |
| `/config` | Application configuration directory |

### Permissions:

Our default permissions are set for user 568.
However: With these containers, permissions are not set using environment variables.

Switching to these images might requires you to either:
1. change permissions to the Persistent Volume (from PVC) (example: `chown -R 568:568 /path/to/volume/`)
or
2. setting the podSecurityContext in the helm charts to your user/group ids, like below:
```
podSecurityContext:
  runAsUser: 1001
  runAsGroup: 1001
  fsGroup: 1001
```
### Environment Variables
|      Name      | Default | Description                                       |
|:--------------:|:-------:|---------------------------------------------------|
|    `UMASK`     | `0002`  | Set the default creation permission mode of files |
| `WAIT_FOR_VPN` | `false` |                                                   |
|  `EXTRA_ARGS`  |         | Additional arguements to pass to the application  |
|      `TZ`      |  `UTC`  | Set to your timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`)    |
