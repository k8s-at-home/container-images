# Container Images

These [container images](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/container-images) are tailored for Kubernetes.

Images are hosted on Github Container Registry [here](https://github.com/orgs/k8s-at-home/packages?ecosystem=container&visibility=public).

## Purpose

The goal of this project and the container images are to support [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and multiple architectures.

We try to keep a [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) when building these images, which means no [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) and all images are built on top of [ubuntu:focal](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu).

## Configuration

For configuration see [here](https://docs.k8s-at-home.com).
